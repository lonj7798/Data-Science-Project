    "Whereas random forests (Chapter 11) build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build an ensemble of shallow trees in sequence with each tree learning and improving on the previous one.\n",

    "- BROWNIAN MOTION STOCHASTIC PROCESS \\\n",
    "Brownian motion is the random motion exhibited by particles which have been suspended in a gas or liquid. This random motion is caused by the collision of the particles with the atoms or molecules in the liquid or gas. Brownian Motion is named after the Botanist Robert Brown who observed the random movements in 1827. The relationship between Brownian Motion and financial markets dates back to a paper written many years later, in 1900, by Louis Bachelier entitled The Theory of Speculation. His paper was the first to propose the use of Brownian Motion to evaluate stock options. The paper did not surface until later works in deriving the famous Black Scholes options pricing formula developed by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes in 1973. In the context of stochastic processes used in finance, Brownian Motion is often described as a Wiener process, denoted by . A Wiener process is described by the following properties,\n",

    "- GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION STOCHASTIC PROCESS \\\n",
    "Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) was popularized by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes when they used it in their 1973 paper, The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities, to derive the Black Scholes equation. Geometric Brownian Motion is essentially Brownian Motion with a drift component and volatility component. The stochastic differential equation which describes the evolution of a Geometric Brownian Motion stochastic process is, where  is the change in the asset price, , at time ;  is the percentage drift expected per annum, , represents time ( is used for daily changes),  is the daily volatility expected in the asset prices, and  is a Wiener process a.k.a Brownian Motion. As can be seen below the Brownian Motion code is used in the Geometric Brownian Motion method to construct a sequence for .\n",

    "- THE MERTON JUMP DIFFUSION STOCHASTIC PROCESS \\\n",
    "Robert C. Merton was one of the first academics to address some of the limitations in the Geometric Brownian Stochastic Process presented by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes. In  1997 Merton and Scholes won a Nobel Price in Economics for their work; Black had unfortunately passed away at that point in time. One of the stochastic processes proposed by Merton addressed the impossibility of a discontinuity occurring in the continuous Geometric Brownian Motion model.\n",

    "- THE HESTON STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY PROCESS \\\n",
    "The original Geometric Brownian Motion stochastic process assumes that volatility over time is constant. In the early 1990's Steven Heston relaxed this assumption and extended the Geometric Brownian Motion model to include stochastic volatility. The resulting model is called the Heston model. In the Heston model volatility over time evolves over time according to the Cox Ingersoll Ross stochastic process. As such the model makes use to two Wiener processes, one for the Cox Ingersoll Ross process and another for the Geometric Brownian Motion process which uses the Cox Ingersoll Ross process as volatility. These two Wiener processes are correlated and can be constructed using a Cholesky Decomposition.\n",

    "- THE COX INGERSOLL ROSS STOCHASTIC PROCESS \\\n",
    "The Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) stochastic process is used to describe the evolution of interest rates over time. The CIR stochastic process was first introduced in 1985 by John Cox, Johnathan Ingersoll, and Stephen Ross. The CIR process is an extension of the Ornstein Uhlenbeck stochastic process. The stochastic process is often used in the valuation of interest rate derivatives and has been used in the Heston model to describe the evolution of volatility over time. One interesting characteristic of the CIR stochastic process is that it is mean-reverting. Mean reversion is the phenomena whereby a level tends to move towards the average level over time. In other words, if the average interest rate is 0.5%, and we simulate 500 independent CIR processes, we would expect the average interest rate at the end of the projection period to be approximately 0.5%. The stochastic differential equation for the CIR process is given by,\n",

    "- THE ORNSTEINâ€“UHLENBECK STOCHASTIC PROCESS \\\n",
    "The Ornstein Uhlebneck stochastic process is another mean-reverting process which is sometimes used for modelling interest rates. The Ornstein Uhlenbeck process is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck. The difference between the Ornstein Uhlenbeck stochastic process and the CIR process is that the CIR processes multiplies the stochastic component by the square root of the previous value for the interest rate. The stochastic differential equation for the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process is,\n",
